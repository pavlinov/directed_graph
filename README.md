### Prerequisites:
1) create `pipenv` virtual environment:
```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```
2) create docker container with postgresql database:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-stack.yml up
```

I decided show two different ways how to work with the database.
That's why I created two different files: `my_graph.py` and `query_my_graph.py`
1) using `psycopg2` library in `my_graph.py` file for loading data into the database
2) using `sqlalchemy` ORM in `query_my_graph.py` file for quering data


### 1. XML file validation against the XSD schema
1) XML file, `directed_graph.xml`
2) XSD schema, `directed_graph_schema.xsd`
```bash
python my_graph.py
```
output:
```
XML is valid against the XSD schema.
Node a added to the database.
Node b added to the database.
Node c added to the database.
Node d added to the database.
Node e added to the database.
Node f added to the database.
Node g added to the database.
Node h added to the database.
Node j added to the database.
Edge e1 added to the database.
Edge e2 added to the database.
Edge e3 added to the database.
Edge e4 added to the database.
Edge e5 added to the database.
Edge e6 added to the database.
Edge e7 added to the database.
Edge e8 added to the database.
Edge e9 added to the database.
Edge e10 added to the database.
Edge e11 added to the database.
Graph data from: your_graph.xml, loaded into the database successfully.
[['g'], ['d', 'e', 'a', 'b', 'c'], ['e', 'a', 'b'], ['h', 'j']]
Graph visualization saved as  ./assets/graph_with_cycles.png
```
image saved into current directory: `graph_with_cycles.png`
image example:
![assets/graph_with_cycles.png](assets/graph_with_cycles.png)

### 2. Part quering the paths and cheapest path
```bash
echo '{"queries": [{"paths": {"start": "a", "end": "e"}}, {"cheapest": {"start": "a", "end": "e"}}]}' | python query_my_graph.py
```
output:
```
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "paths": {
        "from": "a",
        "to": "e",
        "paths": [
          [
            "a",
            "b",
            "c",
            "d",
            "e"
          ],
          [
            "a",
            "b",
            "e"
          ]
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "cheapest": {
        "from": "a",
        "to": "e",
        "path": [
          "a",
          "b",
          "e"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

### 4. Run tests
tests are located in `tests` directory, run tests from the root `./` directory of the project:
unit tests are located in `tests/unit` directory
integration tests are located in `tests/integration` directory
```bash
python -m pytest -v -log_cli=true
```
output example:
```
(opensrs_tucows_test_task) âžœ  opensrs_tucows_test_task python -m pytest -v -log_cli=true
